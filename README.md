ode Scaffolding
Angular CLI provides several commands to help you scaffold and generate components, services, pipes, etc.

To generate a new component:

bash
Copy code
ng generate component component-name
You can also generate other features like directives, pipes, services, classes, guards, interfaces, enums, and modules using the following syntax:

bash
Copy code
ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module
ðŸ“¦ Build
To build the project for production, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
ng build
The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.
This command will prepare your application for deployment by optimizing the files for production.

ðŸ§ª Running Unit Tests
To execute the unit tests for your project, run:

bash
Copy code
ng test
This will run the tests via Karma.
ðŸš€ Running End-to-End Tests
To execute end-to-end tests, run:

bash
Copy code
ng e2e
You will need to add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
